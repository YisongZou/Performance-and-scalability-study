1.
Problem Case: Some client threads will accidentially cannot connect to server due to too many threads at the same time.
How we fixed it: We use a thread pool to restrict the thread numbers that the client side can create.
2.
Problem Case: When we nearly reach the highest throughput, the client side will have some threads that cannot connect to
the server threads.
How we fixed it: When some threads inside the client side cannot connect, we just let them to quit this loop and continue
to connect the next time.
3.
Problem Case: The server side thread will quit acciedentially.
How we fixed it: We find out that we forgot to detach the thread.
4.
Problem Case: There is no thread pool library in c++ stl
How we fixed it: We find a good library to use called CTPL
5.
Problem Case: It is time consuming to test the throughput 5 minutes bu hand
How we fixed it: We use a while loop which will loop for 5 minutes to test
6.
Problem Case: When too many client threads try to connect the server, server will crash.
How we fixed it: After carefully testing, we figured out the best number of client threads for each way.
